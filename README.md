# ERW-Darjeeling-PHREEQC
## Enhanced Rock Weathering Geochemical Modeling for Tea Plantation Carbon Removal

### 🌱 Project Overview
Geochemical simulation of Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) in Darjeeling tea plantation soils using PHREEQC reactive transport modeling. This study quantifies carbon removal potential while demonstrating agricultural co-benefits through soil pH buffering and nutrient release.

### 🎯 Key Results
- **pH Improvement:** +3.73 units (4.8 → 8.53) over 365 days
- **Carbon Sequestration:** Linear alkalinity increase with exponential HCO₃⁻ formation
- **Nutrient Release:** 133% Mg²⁺ increase, stable Ca²⁺ supply
- **Dual Benefits:** Climate action + agricultural soil enhancement

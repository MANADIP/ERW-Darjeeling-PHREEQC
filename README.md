# ERW-Darjeeling-PHREEQC
## Enhanced Rock Weathering Geochemical Modeling for Tea Plantation Carbon Removal

### 🌱 Project Overview
Geochemical simulation of Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) in Darjeeling tea plantation soils using PHREEQC reactive transport modeling. This study quantifies carbon removal potential while demonstrating agricultural co-benefits through soil pH buffering and nutrient release.

### 🎯 Key Results
- **pH Improvement:** +3.73 units (4.8 → 8.53) over 365 days
- **Carbon Sequestration:** Linear alkalinity increase with exponential HCO₃⁻ formation
- **Nutrient Release:** 133% Mg²⁺ increase, stable Ca²⁺ supply
- **Dual Benefits:** Climate action + agricultural soil enhancement

### 🚀 How to Run

#### 1. PHREEQC Simulation

#### 2. Python Visualization

#### Prerequisites
- **PHREEQC 3.8.6+** - Download from [USGS](https://water.usgs.gov/water-resources/software/PHREEQC/)
- **Python 3.7+** with pandas, matplotlib, numpy
- **wateq4f.dat** database (included with PHREEQC installation)

### 🔬 Technical Features
- **Kinetic modeling:** Temperature and pH-dependent mineral dissolution rates
- **Multi-mineral system:** Anorthite, Diopside, Olivine weathering kinetics
- **Real conditions:** Darjeeling climate (18°C) and acidic soil chemistry (pH 4.8)
- **Advanced rate laws:** Arrhenius temperature dependence and pH effects
- **Professional visualization:** Python-based data analysis and plotting

### 📊 Key Findings

#### Soil Chemistry Transformation
- **Initial conditions:** Acidic tea plantation soil (pH 4.8, low nutrients)
- **Final conditions:** Alkaline soil (pH 8.53, enhanced nutrients)
- **Mechanism:** Basalt weathering consumes H⁺ and releases Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺

#### Carbon Removal Quantification
- **Process:** Atmospheric CO₂ → dissolved bicarbonates (HCO₃⁻)
- **Storage timeframe:** >10,000 years in stable carbonate minerals
- **Verification:** Progressive alkalinity increase over 365-day simulation

#### Agricultural Co-benefits
- **Nutrient enhancement:** Essential Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ for plant growth
- **pH buffering:** Optimal conditions for nutrient availability
- **Soil health:** Transformation from acidic, leached soil to fertile growing medium
